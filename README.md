# GL-3SR

This is a repository to run the Fast Graph Learning for Smooth and Sparse Spectral Representation (FGL-3SR) algorithm. FGL-3SR  has a significantly reduced computational complexity due to a well-chosen relaxation compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

A demo on jupyter-notebook is available on this repo. in order to try FGL-3SR.
